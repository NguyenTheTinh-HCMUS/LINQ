+ Deferred querry Execution
	- The querry is excecuted when the the querry variable is
		iterated over in the foreach statement
	- With deferred query exection,the querry variable does not
		hold the querry result--it only stores the querry command
	- The query is actually executed at some point after
		the construction of the querry 
	- It always gives you the lastest data
