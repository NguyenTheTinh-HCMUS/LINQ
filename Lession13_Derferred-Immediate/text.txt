+ Deferred querry Execution
	- The querry is excecuted when the the querry variable is
		iterated over in the foreach statement
	- With deferred query exection,the querry variable does not
		hold the querry result--it only stores the querry command
	- The query is actually executed at some point after
		the construction of the querry 
	- It always gives you the lastest data

+ Immediate Querry Execution
	- In constrast to deferred exection of querries that produce a sequence
		of values,queries that return a singleton value are executed immediately.
	- Eg of singleton queries are Avarage,Count,Fist and Max.
	- To force  the immediate execution of a querry that does not produce
		a singleton value, you can call the ToList method or ToArray method
